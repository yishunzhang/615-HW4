# HW introduction

## (a)

As we discussed in lecture on Wednesday, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration(NOAA) keeps track of meteorological data from a number of buoys. For this exercise, we
 are interested in Buoy number 44013 located sixteen nautical miles east of Boston Harbour
 and the questions will deal with data from that buoy.
 This is the link to the National Data Buoy Center: https://www.ndbc.noaa.gov/
 This is the link to the buoy of interest: https://www.ndbc.noaa.gov/station_page.php?station=44013
 a Your first exercise is to read in the data for all the years from 1985 to 2023. As discussed
 in class, you don’t want to do this manually and will need to figure out a way to do it
 programmatically. We’ve given you a skeleton of how to do this for data for one year below.
 Your task is to adapt this to reading in multiple datasets from all the years in question. This
 example code is meant to be a guide and if you think of a better way to read the data in, go
 for it.
 Keep in mind that initially, these datasets did not record units and then started to do so in
 the line below the column headers. So for some years you will have to skip 1 instead of 2.
 In addition to reading in this data, use lubridate to create a proper date column.
 
```{r}
file_root<-"https://www.ndbc.noaa.gov/view_text_file.php?filename=44013h"
 year<-"2023"
 tail<- ".txt.gz&dir=data/historical/stdmet/"
 path<-paste0(file_root,year,tail)
 header=scan(path,what= 'character',nlines=1)
 buoy<-fread(path,header=FALSE,skip=2)
 colnames(buoy)<-header
```
Save your code in an R Script with an appropriate name which you must include in your Github
 submission. Keep in mind that if we clone your repository, this script must run without errors
 for you to get credit. Remember to comment your code for readability.
 For the following questions (b through d), you will need to put your code, its output, and your
 written answers into a pdf. One way to do this is to use R Markdown or Quarto and knit into
 a pdf. Include the rmd/qmd file as well the pdf in the github repository you submit.
 
```{r}
library(data.table)
library(lubridate)

file_root <- "https://www.ndbc.noaa.gov/view_text_file.php?filename=44013h"
tail <- ".txt.gz&dir=data/historical/stdmet/"

all_years_data <- list()

for (year in 1985:2023) {

  path <- paste0(file_root, year, tail)
  
  tryCatch({
   
    header <- scan(path, what = 'character', nlines = 1, quiet = TRUE)
    
  
    buoy <- fread(path, header = FALSE, skip = 2, fill = TRUE)
    
    
    if (length(header) > ncol(buoy)) {
      header <- header[1:ncol(buoy)]
    } else if (ncol(buoy) > length(header)) {
      buoy[, extra_col := NA]  
    }
    
    colnames(buoy) <- header
    
    if ("#YY" %in% colnames(buoy)) {
      buoy$YEAR <- ifelse(year >= 2007, as.numeric(buoy$`#YY`), 
                          ifelse(as.numeric(buoy$`#YY`) < 100, as.numeric(buoy$`#YY`) + 1900, as.numeric(buoy$`#YY`)))
    } else if ("YY" %in% colnames(buoy)) {
      buoy$YEAR <- ifelse(as.numeric(buoy$YY) < 100, as.numeric(buoy$YY) + 1900, as.numeric(buoy$YY))
    } else {
      buoy$YEAR <- year 
    }
   
    if (all(c("MM", "DD", "hh", "mm") %in% colnames(buoy))) {
      buoy$date <- ymd_hms(paste(buoy$YEAR, buoy$MM, buoy$DD, buoy$hh, buoy$mm), quiet = TRUE)
    } else {
      buoy$date <- NA 
    }
   
    all_years_data[[as.character(year)]] <- buoy
    
    message("Successfully processed year: ", year)
    
  }, error = function(e) {

    message("Failed to process year: ", year, " - ", e$message)
  })
}

all_data <- rbindlist(all_years_data, use.names = TRUE, fill = TRUE)

print(head(all_data))

```
 
 
## (b)
Your next exercise is to identify and deal with the null data in the dataset.Recall from class
 that for WDIR and some other variables these showed up as 999 in the dataset. Convert them
 to NA’s.
 
```{r}
# Define missing value placeholders for relevant columns
missing_values <- c(999, 999.0, 9999, 99.0, 99.00)

# Columns to check for missing values
columns_to_check <- setdiff(colnames(all_data), "YEAR")  # All except 'YEAR'

# Loop through columns and replace 99, 999, 9999 with NA
for (col in columns_to_check) {
  all_data[get(col) %in% missing_values, (col) := NA]
}

# Ensure that NA's were applied correctly
summary(all_data)
```

```{r}
#Summarize the number of NAs for WDIR by year and plot the number of NAs over time
na_summary_by_year <- all_data %>%
  group_by(YEAR) %>%
  summarise(WDIR_NA_count = sum(is.na(WDIR)),
            total_count = n())

# Plot the number of NAs over time
ggplot(na_summary_by_year, aes(x = YEAR, y = WDIR_NA_count)) +
  geom_line(color = "blue") +
  geom_point() +
  labs(title = "Number of Missing WDIR Values Over Time", 
       x = "Year", 
       y = "Count of NAs") +
  theme_minimal()
```

### (b.1) Is it always appropriate to convert missing/null data to NA’s? When might it not.
When it is missing data, converting placeholders like 999 or 99.0 to NA is appropriate. This makes it clear that the data is absent and allows statistical functions to handle the missing values correctly.
When the placeholder 999 or similar values have specific meanings other than "missing" (e.g., outliers, extreme conditions), converting these to NA might lose important information.

### (b.2) Analyze the pattern of NA’s. Do you spot any patterns in the way/dates that these are distributed?

Between 1985 and 2005, missing data remained stable with minor fluctuations, suggesting routine operational and maintenance activities. A notable improvement occurred from 2006 to 2015, with missing values nearly eliminated, likely due to advancements in sensor technology and better monitoring systems. However, from 2016 onwards, especially after 2020, there was a sharp increase in missing data, reaching over 20,000 instances by 2023. This recent surge could be attributed to equipment failures, decreased maintenance capabilities due to external factors like COVID-19, and possible budgetary constraints affecting the regular upkeep of data collection systems.


## (c)
Can you use the Buoy data to see the effects of climate change? Create visualizations to
 show this and justify your choices. Can you think of statistics you can use to bolster what
 your plots represent? Calculate these, justify your use of them. Add this code, its output,
 your answers and visualizations to your pdf.

### (c.1)
Plot1: Annual Average Air and Water Temperature (1985–2023):
This plot shows the average annual air temperature (red line) and water temperature (blue line) over time. Both air and water temperatures show an upward trend over the years. Water temperature appears to have more variability but rises more significantly compared to air temperature, especially after 2000.

### (c.2)
Plot2: Trends in Air and Water Temperature (1985–2023):
This scatter plot with trend lines highlights the gradual increase in both air and water temperatures. Water temperature (cyan points) shows a steeper upward trend, suggesting that ocean warming is occurring at a faster rate compared to atmospheric warming. 

These increasing trends are consistent with the global effects of climate change, where warming oceans and rising air temperatures are major indicators.

### (c.3)
Plot3: Temperature Anomalies (1985–2023):
This bar plot illustrates temperature anomalies, showing deviations from the long-term average for both air and water temperatures. There is a noticeable increase in temperature anomalies (both positive and negative) after the year 2000, with more frequent positive anomalies, especially in water temperatures after 2010.

This suggests that both air and water temperatures are increasing more frequently beyond their historical norms, a clear indicator of climate variability and the impact of climate change.
 
 
## (d)
As part of this Homework, you have been given data for rainfall in Boston from 1985
 to the end of 2013. Your job for this exercise is to see if you can spot any patterns between
 rainfall(whether it happens and how much of it there is) and the readings taken by the weather
 buoy in the same period. There are a number of ways you can do this but the broad steps
 are: 1) Acquaint yourself with the data. Look at distributions and summary statistics(dplyr
 is great for coaxing means, averages, counts out of data). 2) Create visualizations. Can you
 see patterns in the distributions and visualizations? Investigate these with more statistics and
 visualizations. 3) Try building a very simple model. Explain your choices at every step. Do
 you come away from this exercise with more sympathy for the weather people on TV who keep
 getting their forecasts wrong?
 
```{r}
# Load the rainfall data
rainfall_data <- read.csv("C:/Users/17756/Downloads/Rainfall.csv")

head(rainfall_data$DATE)

```{r}
# Step 1: Parse the DATE column using ymd_hm
rainfall_data$DATE <- ymd_hm(rainfall_data$DATE)
```

```{r}
# Step 2: Extract the year from the parsed DATE column
rainfall_data$YEAR <- year(rainfall_data$DATE)
```

```{r}
# Step 3: Summarize total rainfall by year
rainfall_by_year <- rainfall_data %>%
  group_by(YEAR) %>%
  summarise(total_rainfall = sum(HPCP, na.rm = TRUE))  # Sum the total rainfall for each year

print(head(rainfall_by_year))


buoy_data_by_year <- all_data %>%

    avg_water_temp = mean(WTMP, na.rm = TRUE),    # Average Water Temperature
    avg_wind_speed = mean(WSPD, na.rm = TRUE)     # Average Wind Speed

       y = "Value") +
  scale_color_manual(values = c("Rainfall" = "blue", "Water Temperature (x10)" = "green")) +

Although Rainfall remains relatively stable, the ATMP & WTMP are in an increasing trend.
